### Eleventy Docs

I tried putting some docs in /site for generation with [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/).
To get started:

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) if you don't have it
- Install [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) if you don't have it (comes with Linux and Mac)
- git clone https://github.com/jjwolverine/csf.git
- cd site
- npm install
- npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
- visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
